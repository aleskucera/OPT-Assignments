    "We can interpret the system as a simple model of a vehicle moving in one dimension. The state dimension is $n = 2$, with $x_1(t)$ denoting the position of the vehicle at time $t$ and $x_2(t)$ giving its velocity. The initial state is (0, 0), which corresponds to the vehicle at rest at position 0; the final state is $x_{des} = (10, 0)$, which corresponds to the vehicle being at rest at position 10. Roughly speaking, this means that the actuator input affects the velocity, which in turn affects the position. The coefficient $A_{22} = 0.95$ means that velocity decays by 5% in one sample period, if no actuator signal is applied. Plot the input signal $u(t)$ for $t = 0, . . . , 19$, and the position and velocity (i.e., $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$) for $t = 0, . . . , 20$."
